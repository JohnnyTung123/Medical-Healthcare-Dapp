# Medical-Healthcare-Dapp
My first Solidity project to develop a decentralized medical healthcare DApp, enabling secure storage of patient records and medical reports on the Ethereum blockchain. Built with React.js for frontend, MongoDB for sensitive data, and Truffle for blockchain development.

## Doctor Functions
- **Create Medical Records**: Enables doctors to create medical records for patients securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **View Medical Records**: Allows doctors to view existing medical records of patients with authorized access.

## Future Development Plan
- **Appointment Management Function**: Implementing ERC token for appointment management, enhancing the functionality of the DApp.
- **UI Improvement**: Continuously working on improving the user interface for better user experience and accessibility.
